# Pacman AI Project (UC Berkeley)

This project provides a framework for building AI agents that play the classic Pacman game. It includes:

- **Game Environment:** A simplified Pacman game with a grid-based maze, food pellets, walls, and ghosts.
- **Feature Extraction:** Various feature extractors to represent game states for learning agents.
- **Reflex Agents and Q-Learning:** Sample agents that make decisions based on features or learned Q-values.
- **Search and Planning:** Support for search algorithms used in pathfinding and decision making.

The goal is to implement and experiment with AI techniques like reinforcement learning, search, and feature engineering to create intelligent Pacman agents.
